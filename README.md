# soptRT
sopt = "small optimizer"; a Python AI Optimizer and Code Generator.

Honestly, not fully sure what I want to do with this yet. I'm taking this opportunity to learn Rust though.
Get started with: 
```
cd backend
cargo run
```

Goals are:
* TensorRT from scratch
* nvFuser from scratch

And I want to find ways to integrate LLM opt as well. Will probably extend with TVM/MLIR/LLVM.

Backend will be written in Rust.

### tracer
This module captures the DFG from the Python code.

### opt

### cgen
