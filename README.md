# SwiftVM
AI acceleration compiler for Swift.

Honestly, not fully sure what I want to do with this yet. Nor do I know if it will continue in Swift...

Routes are:
* TensorRT for Apple Silicon
* nvFuser for Apple Silicon
* My own MSL

I want to be able to leverage my device's internal language model by the end.
